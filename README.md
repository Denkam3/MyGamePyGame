# MyGamePyGame

This project is aiming to transform Project Dungeon which we did in school to a PyGame.
Instead of writing a new code, I decided to add pygame functions into an existing project.
There is a lot of unnecessary code which is a remnant of the Project Dungeon itself.
It is still a work in progress.
The code will be cleaned in the future and new functions are coming!
